# Blinding A Seed Phrase Using BIP32 Paths

For this demo, we'll use [Specter-Desktop](https://github.com/cryptoadvance/specter-desktop/) (powered by bitcoin core) as it's the de-facto standard for almost all soverign multisig users in 2021.
We'll also duplicate the code in [buidl](https://github.com/buidl-bitcoin/buidl-python) as it's a no-dependency bitcoin implementaiton written in python that is very easy to use.

## Buidl Setup
Easiest way
```
$ pip install buidl-python && python3
```

More secure way:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/buidl-bitcoin/buidl-python.git && cd buidl-python && python3
```
(because `buidl` has no dependencies and is designed for simple airgap use, you don't need to install it)

## Generate 2 Seed Phrases
Letâ€™s assume that seed phrase A is held by (and generated by) me and seed B is held by (and generated by) a semi-trusted third party (e.g. a lawyer, accountant, heir, close friend, "uncle Jim" bitcoiner, etc).

### Seed Phrase A
```
BIP39 Seed Phrase (invest repeated 12x):
invest invest invest invest invest invest invest invest invest invest invest invest

Public Key Record (from hardware wallet):
[aa917e75/48h/1h/0h/2h]tpubDEZRP2dRKoGRJnR9zn6EoLouYKbYyjFsxywgG7wMQwCDVkwNvoLhcX1rTQipYajmTAF82kJoKDiNCgD4wUPahACE7n1trMSm7QS8B3S1fdy
```

### Seed Phrase B
```
BIP39 Seed Phrase (sell repeated x12):
sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell

Public Key Record (from hardware wallet):
[2553c4b8/48h/1h/0h/2h]tpubDEiNuxUt4pKjKk7khdv9jfcS92R1WQD6Z3dwjyMFrYj2iMrYbk3xB5kjg6kL4P8SoWsQHpd378RCTrM7fsw4chnJKhE2kfbfc4BCPkVh6g9
```

### Verification

This could be generated in build as follows:
```
from buidl import HDPrivateKey

investx12_pubkey_record = HDPrivateKey.from_mnemonic("invest " * 12, testnet=True).generate_p2wsh_key_record()
sellx12_pubkey_record = HDPrivateKey.from_mnemonic("sell " * 12, testnet=True).generate_p2wsh_key_record()
print("investx12", investx12_pubkey_record)
print("sellx12", sellx12_pubkey_record)
```
